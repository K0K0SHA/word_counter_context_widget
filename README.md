#word_counter_context_widget
Word and character counter context widgets intended to work either with Firefox, Chromium, and Chrome. It appears in the right-click Context menu.
As of this writing (6/6/2024), Chrome is switching to Manifest v3 and extensions with Manifest v2 will stop working soon. So the extension needs to be written in manifest v3.
Starting out, I will write the extension in Manifest v2 firefox.

What is Manifest exactly: ???
How to check Manifest version: ???
